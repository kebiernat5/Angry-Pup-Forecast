## Description
```
Who are we building this for?
We are building this for people with a sense of humor that like dogs and need a forecast.
What is the user trying to achieve?
The user is trying to expand their lexicon of dad-jokes, while making sure they are well dressed for the day.
Why do they want to achieve this?
They do not always remember to look for random dad-jokes but they ARE in the habit of looking for the weather daily.
How does it work?
Given that I am a user who has a sense of humor, likes puppies, and needs to see the weather every day. When I type any city into a search query, a photo of a random puppy is generated along with a random dad-joke, this will include the weather forecast for that day and the next 5 days of the searched city.
